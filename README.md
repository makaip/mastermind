# Mastermind

This is an online replica of the game *Mastermind*, first created by 	Mordecai Meirowitz in 1970. To begin, simply `CLICK` each one of the four squares. To cycle through the different colors, continue clicking on the squares until you reach the desired color. All squares must be colored. Once all colors are filled, press `SPACE`, or click the right-most buton. Then, your response will appear above. `WHITE` pegs represent a guessed color that is correct, but in the wrong location. `RED` pegs represent a guessed color that is correct, and in the correct location. In order to win, guess the correct combination in under five moves.
